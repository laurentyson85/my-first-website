            <h3>Who am I and why I&#8217ve started to code</h3> 
            <p>As an adult, I moved from the midwest to Montana. I love adventure, I love the outdoors, and I wanted a slower pace. Years later, I've never left. I embraced Montana and its natural way of life.
                I married a fly fisherman and we bought a home on the river. Soon, his love for the beautiful waters of Montana became mine. We spend most of our time outdoors with our dogs; fly fishing, camping, hiking, and just walking the river bank.</p>
            
            <p>As an artist, Montana is the perfect place for inspiration. I make it my job to capture, paint, and share my experiences with others. But it's hard. How do you harness a vast place like Montana in a painting?
                The colorful fish visible beneath crystal clear glacial waters. The staggering Rocky Mountains are so massive that they're hard to take in. The rugged forest and vast fields go on for miles. It's all so.....big. But this is my life, and I love it.</p>

            <p>So what does all that have to do with coding? Well, the missing piece to my life is a career that matches my lifestyle. Programming is <em>creative exploration</em> and that will match the vibes of my lifestyle.</p>
            
            <p>I adventured into Montana and embraced painting. Now, it&#8217s time to adventure into a new career to match.</p>
