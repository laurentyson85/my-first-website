            <h3>Who am I and why I&#8217ve started to code</h3> 
            <p>As an adult, I moved from the midwest to Montana. I love adventure, I love the outdoors, and I wanted a slower pace. Years later, I've never left. I embraced Montana and its natural way of life.
                I married a fly fisherman and we bought a home on the river. Soon, his love for the beautiful waters of Montana became mine. We spend most of our time outdoors with our dogs; fly fishing, camping, hiking, and just walking the river bank.</p>
            
            <p>Montana is the perfect place for inspiration. I make it my job to capture and paint my experiences. But it's hard. How do you harness a vast place like Montana in a painting?
                It's all so.....big. But this is my life, and I love it.</p>

            <p>So what does all that have to do with coding? Well, the missing piece is a career that matches my lifestyle. To me, programming is <em>creative exploration</em> and that will match my vibes.</p>
            
            <p>I adventured into Montana. Now, it&#8217s time to adventure into a new career.</p>
